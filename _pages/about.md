The Students’ Conference on Linguistics (JNU-SCoL 2022) will take place on 2-3-4 March 2023. The Conference is being organised by [the Centre for Linguistics](https://www.jnu.ac.in/sllcs/cl) at [Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), Delhi in collaboration with [the Central Institute of Indian Languages](https://ciil.org/) (CIIL), Mysuru.
The Conference is a students’ conference where the preference for paper presentations will be given to graduate students and research scholars. JNU-SCoL 2022 will take place within the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. The Conference is strictly restricted for students and scholars below the level of post-doctorate. For those who are enrolled in PhD in any institute, non-submission of the doctoral thesis would be the criteria for abstracts submission.
The Centre for Linguistics, instituted within the School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies (SLL&CS) at Jawaharlal Nehru University, is one of the leading centres for linguistics and language studies in India. The Centre in its present form was constituted in 2005 but had existed since 1974 as a Group of Linguistics that merged with the Group of English and constituted the Centre of Linguistics and English in 1978.
The Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore, was set up in 1969 to assist and co-ordinate the development of Indian Languages. The Institute is charged with the responsibility of serving as a nucleus to bring together all the research and literary output from the various linguistic streams to a common head and narrow the gap between the basic research and developmental research in the field of languages and linguistics in India. CIIL also runs seven Regional Centres in the various linguistic regions of the country to help and meet the demand for trained teachers to implement the three-language formula and thereby provide assurance to linguistic minorities.
JNU-SCoL 2022 will be focused on the latest research in all areas of linguistics with a special emphasis on the recent advances in theoretical linguistics, phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and sociolinguistics. The Conference will act as a forum for young scholars and researchers to share their novel work and ideas, and to discuss the latest developments in the field. The Conference focuses on providing a space for students to share their research with each other, developing their skills as researchers, and learning about different research methods and approaches in the field of linguistics. Additionally, the Conference aims to provide networking opportunities for students to bond with and learn from other students and professionals in the field.
JNU-SCoL 2022 will be a three-day affair on 2-3-4 March 2023. The first two days, i.e., 2 and 3 March 2023, will have sessions for the presentations, including a poster presentation session. The third day, i.e., 4 March 2023, is reserved for workshops. The Conference will also feature a number of keynote speeches from leading experts in the field. A more detailed schedule will be duly uploaded on the website.
JNU-SCoL 2022 will follow strict anti-sexual harassment and anti-racism policy.
